# 🌐 GitHub Hosting Guide for Moodle 5.0.1

## 🤔 Can I Host Moodle on GitHub?

**Short Answer:** GitHub doesn't directly host PHP applications, but we provide excellent GitHub-integrated alternatives!

## 📝 GitHub Hosting Options Explained

### ❌ GitHub Pages (Not Compatible)
- **What it supports:** Static websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **What it doesn't support:** PHP applications, databases, server-side processing
- **Why Moodle won't work:** Moodle requires PHP 8.1+ and MySQL database

### ✅ GitHub Codespaces (Development Only)
- **What it's for:** Development and testing
- **Current setup:** ✅ Already configured in this repository
- **Access:** `https://[your-codespace]-8080.app.github.dev`
- **Limitations:** Not for production, limited uptime

## 🚀 Best GitHub-Integrated Hosting Solutions

### 1. 🌟 Railway.app (Recommended - Feels Like GitHub Hosting!)

**Why it's the best GitHub hosting alternative:**
- ✅ **Direct GitHub Integration:** Auto-deploys from your GitHub repository
- ✅ **One-Click Setup:** Connect repo → automatic deployment
- ✅ **Live Public URL:** Instantly shareable with SSL
- ✅ **Auto-Updates:** Push to GitHub = automatic redeployment
- ✅ **Managed Database:** PostgreSQL included
