## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly
3. **DO** use one of these secure channels:

#### Preferred Methods:
- 📧 **Email**: Send details to the repository maintainer
- 🔒 **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab in the repository
- 💬 **Private Discussion**: Request a private discussion thread

### What to Include
When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step reproduction instructions

- **1 month**: Public disclosure (after fix is available)

## 🔧 Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Always use Moodle's database API (no raw SQL)
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Escape all outputs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow secure coding practices
- Regular security testing

### For Deployment
- Use strong database passwords
- Enable firewall protection
- Keep system packages updated
- Use HTTPS with valid certificates
- Configure secure file permissions
- Enable security headers
- Regular security audits

### For Users
- Use strong administrator passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Regular backups
- Monitor access logs
- Keep Moodle updated
- Limit user privileges
- Regular security reviews

## 🛠️ Security Configuration

### Database Security
```php
// Secure database configuration
$CFG->dbtype    = 'mysqli';
$CFG->dbhost    = 'localhost';
$CFG->dbname    = 'moodle';
$CFG->dbuser    = 'moodleuser';  // Limited privileges user
$CFG->dbpass    = 'strong_password';
$CFG->prefix    = 'mdl_';
```

### Session Security
```php
// Secure session settings
$CFG->cookiesecure = true;        // HTTPS only
$CFG->cookiehttponly = true;      // No JavaScript access
$CFG->sessiontimeout = 7200;      // 2 hours
```

### File Security
```bash
# Secure file permissions
chmod 755 /path/to/moodle
chmod 777 /path/to/moodledata
chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/moodle
```

## 🚀 Environment-Specific Security
